## Program Design
### Functions/Classes Overview
```python
# Example structure
class MainProgram:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    def start_program(self):
        pass
    
    def process_data(self):
        pass
```

### Data Storage
- How will your program store data?
  - Text files
  - CSV files
  - JSON files
  - [Other storage methods]

### Error Handling
- What types of errors might occur?
- How will you handle them?
```python
try:
    # Main operations
except SpecificError:
    # Error handling
```

## Testing Strategy
- How will you test your program?
- What test cases will you create?
```python
# Example test case
def test_main_function():
    # Test code here
    pass
```

## Project Delivery
### Running the Program
- Step-by-step instructions to run your program
- Required Python version
- How to install dependencies (if any)

### Sample Usage
```python
# Example usage of your program
python main.py
```

## Potential Challenges
