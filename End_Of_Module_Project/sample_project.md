# Python Capstone Project: Local Restaurant Finder


## Project Overview
### Project Title
Local Restaurant Finder and Reviews Aggregator

### Project Summary
A Python program that helps users find local restaurants using Google Maps API and scrapes review data from permitted restaurant review websites. The program will display restaurant information, ratings, and recent reviews in a user-friendly interface.

## Problem Statement
- Many people struggle to find reliable restaurant recommendations in their area
- Scattered review information across multiple websites
- Need for consolidated restaurant data in one place

## Technical Details
### Required Components
1. **Python Version**
   - Python 3.8+

2. **Core Python Concepts Used**
   - [ ] Functions and Error Handling
   - [ ] API Integration
   - [ ] Web Scraping
   - [ ] File Operations
   - [ ] GUI Development

3. **Libraries Needed**
   - [ ] `requests` - for API calls
   - [ ] `beautifulsoup4` - for web scraping
   - [ ] `tkinter` - for GUI
   - [ ] `json` - for data handling
   - [ ] `googlemaps` - Google Maps API client

4. **API Keys**
   - Google Maps API Key (Will be stored securely)

## Program Structure
### Core Features

1. **Location Search**
- I'll create a function to get user location input through a simple text entry
- For the Google Maps integration:
  - Will initialize the Google Maps client with our API key
  - Plan to search for restaurants within a 1km radius
  - Need to handle API response and extract relevant restaurant details
  - Should include error handling for API failures

2. **Web Scraping Reviews**
- Will create a scraping function that:
  - Sets up proper headers to respect website policies
  - Uses BeautifulSoup to parse HTML
  - Targets specific HTML elements containing reviews
  - Includes error handling for failed requests
  - Implements delay between requests to be respectful

3. **GUI Interface**
- Planning a Tkinter-based interface with:
  - Search bar at the top
  - Results displayed in a scrollable frame
  - Each restaurant as a card-like element
  - Click functionality to show more details
  - Separate window for detailed reviews
  - Status bar for operation feedback

### Data Storage
- Will implement JSON-based storage system
- Need functions for:
  - Saving restaurant data with proper formatting
  - Loading saved data efficiently
  - Updating existing records
  - Handling file not found scenarios

```

## Implementation Plan
- In main.py:
  - Will set up the main program flow
  - Initialize GUI
  - Connect all components

- In api_handler.py:
  - Plan to create Google Maps client wrapper
  - Implement all API-related functions
  - Include rate limiting

- In web_scraper.py:
  - Design scraping functions
  - Implement ethical scraping practices
  - Add data cleaning methods

- In gui.py:
  - Create main application window
  - Design all frames and widgets
  - Implement event handlers

## Error Handling Approach
- Will create a decorator for API errors
- Plan to implement specific exception handlers for:
  - Network errors
  - API limits
  - Invalid data
  - File operations
- Want to add user-friendly error messages

## Testing Strategy
- Need to test:
  - API connection and responses
  - Scraper functionality
  - Data storage operations
  - GUI interactions
- Will use print statements and basic assertions initially

## Setup and Running
1. Package Installation:
   - Will list all required packages in requirements.txt
   - Include specific versions for compatibility

2. Configuration:
   - Plan to use environment variables for API keys
   - Create configuration file for adjustable parameters

3. Program Execution:
   - Will create clear startup instructions
   - Include command-line arguments for different modes

## Future Improvements
1. Add filters for cuisine types
2. Implement user reviews submission
3. Add mapping visualization
4. Create a restaurant booking system
